       My professional journey officially began in <br> 2024, marked by the rigorous preparation for the JAMB examinations, <br> where Mathematics and Physics were my core focus areas. This <br>period was crucial, as it forged a resilient, logic-driven approach to <br> complex problems-a necessary skill in Cybersecurity. <br> <br> Following this preparatory phase, I successfully secured admission to <br> study Information Technology at Redeemers University. My academic <br> focus remains deeply commited to mastering the fundamentals of IT, <br> which directly supports my cybersecurity aspirations. <br> <br> As a dedicated 200L student, I am commited to mastering the basic <br> foundational IT concepts especially Networking and Operating Systems <br> because you cannot secure what you do not fully understand. However I, <br> understand that for cybersecurity, the "how" is more important than the <br> "what". For example, while I know the OSI model, my current, urgent <br> focus is on deeply understanding the behaviour within Layers 3 and 4. <br><br>This is where my "Redeemers Journey" truly manifests: I am not content <br> with theoretical knowledge alone; towards fluency in the tools that expose <br> that knowledge in action.
